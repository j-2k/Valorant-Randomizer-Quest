# Valorant Randomizer
A simple and funny software idea for my friends. Simply generates a random weapon &amp; agent to use depending on multiple factors, with maybe some... twists I guess?

### Main Features: (Priority/100% included)
- Generate a random choice of the following categories:
  - Agents
  - Weapons


### Extra Features: (Not a priority/might not be included)
- Generate a random choice of the following categories:
  - Abilities
  - Rules?
  - Playstyles
  - Quests

## Build/Repository information for nerds

### Original Project Plans:
- Desktop Application (web is better but I want to learn desktop garbage)
- Target Windows 10 & 11
-  ~~Planning to use either imgui (cpp) or winUI3 (c#) for UI framework.~~
- Welp, I decided to use WF because I need to learn it for work.

### Building the project:
- I used VS 2022 & .NET Framework 4.8
- WIP
