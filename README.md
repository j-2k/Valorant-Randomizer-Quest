# Valorant Randomizer
A simple and funny software idea for my friends. Simply generates a random weapon &amp; agent to use depending on multiple factors, with maybe some... twists I guess?

WIP Pictures go here!

### Main Features: (Priority/100% included)
- Generate a random choice of the following categories:
  - Agents
    - Select specific **agents** to draw into the pool for random generation
  - Loadout
    - Select specific **menu items** to draw into the pool for random generation
    - Any single weapon only (main) OR Primary & Secondary weapon (option)
    - Consider shields into the mix (option)
    - ~~Should primary take priority with current money over secondary in randomization if both primary & secondary option is chosen???~~ (thinking of adding this not sure yet)


### Extra Features: (Not a priority/might not be included)
- Generate a random choice of the following categories:
  - Abilities
  - Rules?
  - Playstyles
  - Quests

## Build/Repository information for nerds

### Original Project Plans:
- Desktop Application (web is better but I want to learn desktop garbage)
- Target Windows 10 & 11
-  ~~Planning to use either imgui (cpp) or winUI3 (c#) for UI framework.~~
- Welp, I decided to use WF because I need to learn it for work.

### Building the project:
Notes:  
- I used VS 2022 & .NET Framework 4.8
- Tested on different machine while using VS 2019 still works fine!
  
Steps:
1) Open solution (.sln) file with visual studio (pref 2022)... thats it.  
(Try building the project, it "should" work... unless you get funny building error moment)
